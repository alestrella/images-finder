# Images Finder App

### Task - Image Search (HTTP requests)

- Build a front-end part of a keyword search and image viewer application. Add some decoration to
  the interface elements.
- Use the public API of the Pixabay service as a back-end. Sign up, get your unique access key and
  read the documentation.

### Additional options

- Add the display of large images with the SimpleLightbox library for a full gallery.
- Page scrolling. Make smooth page scrolling after the request and rendering each next group of
  images.
- Infinite scrolling. Instead of the "Load more" button, you can make an infinite loading of images
  when scrolling the page. You are free to choose your ways of implementation and libraries.
